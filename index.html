                    <p>You're probably wondering just who I am! I grew up in sunny <mark>San Diego</mark> and developed a love for <mark>alt-rock, carne asada, and salty breezes.</mark></p>
                    <p>I am currently attending the <mark>University of California, Irvine</mark> as an undergraduate student studying Informatics with a specialisation in Human-Computer Interaction. I have been working recently on developing my technicals skills as a website <mark>developer</mark>, my creative skills as a <mark>designer</mark>, and my people skills as a user <mark>researcher.</mark></p>
                    <p>My most current interests are operating as the publicity chair for the <mark>Japanese American club</mark> at UCI, planning a week long <mark>roadtrip</mark> for winter break, and waiting for some Murakami <mark>books</mark> to come off hold at the library.</p>
