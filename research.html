                        <p>The user interviews were critical in finding the direction and overall vision for my online portfolio. The questions and corresponding answers were more high-level and directed around the purpose of the project and the identity of myself as the owner. Further questions focused on career goals and the role that a portfolio plays in developing a career.</p>

                        <p>The competitor analysis gave me more technical and interactive input on my portfolio compared to the user interviews. It was here that I began to study which design elements to include in my own site and which pitfalls to avoid based upon researching prominent portfolios for individuals as well as organizations. I made sure to focus on individuals and organizations in the design industry since that it is where I wanted to direct my own personal portfolio. I studied what worked well, what was confusing, and why these aspects occurred.</p>

                        <p>In the feature value matrix I took educated estimates at the development efforts required for the potential features that I had in mind for my online portfolio as well as the potential values of the features to myself (the business) and users of my site. The synthesized development effort and values of each feature allowed me to quantifiably compare each. The features I chose were core features that I believed were necessary to my site as well as some features that I thought stimulating or attractive to users.</p>

                        <p>I prioritized the features largely based upon the totals assigned in the feature value matrix. Delightful features had higher values and higher development effort, basic features had lower values and lower development effort, and performance features sat comfortably in the middle. The segregation of features based upon priority allowed me to focus on the most critical and implementable features first and made sure that I had important content on the site before I became overwhelmed with more superficial aspects.</p>

                        <p>User stories allowed me to better understand what users would need specific features for and what they might use the website for. The distinguishing feature of this was the emphasis on the motivation behind users in their actions and their overall goals. These were created by quickly role-playing as potential users of my website (hiring managers, co-workers, clients) and figuring out what they would with the site.</p>

It was a live narration of different users performing actions on the site and the monitoring of what worked well for them and what they struggled with. The emphasis here was usability and efficiency of actions as well as to remove any obstacles repeatedly encountered.</p>

                        <p>I chose to do a question test and a click test. The click test was done to understand how users intuitively navigated through my site and to make sure that I supported this process. The question test also provided basic insight into site navigation, but also utilized questions to get more qualitative data about how users felt about the aesthetics of the site and its content.</p>

            <p>Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of your findings.  Be sure to include insights from conducting your research and tests as well as any challenges faced.  If you are not quite sure of what conclusions can be drawn, pose a hypothesis as to possible solutions.

            <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
            <p>Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it.</p>
